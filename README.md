"You play as an office worker in a retro futuristic world, stuck at a mundane desk job. Instead of working, you immerse yourself in Snake++, a game on your portable console where you grow by consuming competitors and rising to the top of the corporate food chain."

Game Inspirations:
Snake, Balatro, Stanley Parable

## Gameplay

Rooms are time based. Each room will be ~1 minute long except for the boss room being longer. 

The player's goal is to survive, collect food and buy upgrades from the shop.

Throughout each room, the player will carry through the snake's size.

The snake will always spawn from the bottom centre tile moving upwards.
