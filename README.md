# SnakeRoguelike

A small game that everyone is familiar with that has been expanded on. To get back into the feels of making a game and be able to make one that is relatively simple to achieve

Snake but with abilities and upgrades you can buy with a roguelike game loop

A game that hopefully can be made within 12~14 weeks full-time. Longer part-time
