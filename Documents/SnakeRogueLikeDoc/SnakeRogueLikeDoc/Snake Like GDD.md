Snake but with abilities and upgrades you can buy with a roguelike game loop.

"You play as an office worker in a retro futuristic world, stuck at a mundane desk job. Instead of working, you immerse yourself in Snake++, a game on your portable console where you grow by consuming competitors and rising to the top of the corporate food chain."

Internal meanings of the game: 
Boredom of an mundane office job. Stuck in the world of Capitalism. 
Escapism. 

## Gameplay

Rooms are time based. Each room will be ~1 minute long except for the boss room being longer. 

The player's goal is to survive, collect food and buy upgrades from the shop.

Throughout each room, the player will carry through the snake's size.

The snake will always spawn from the bottom centre tile moving upwards.

The game uses grid based movement just like the original Snake.

Monopoly - Growing exponentially big.

Game Inspiration:
Snake, Balatro

Ability Level Ups:
- Locked in ability level ups

## Game Mechanics

### Rooms

Players will be put on a timer for each room they have to survive in. There are only 2 types of rooms. The boss rooms and the normal rooms. There will be variations of normal rooms and boss rooms.

Room Types:
- Shop
- 3 different room types (speed multiplied room, room with more walls, etc)
- Boss

### Non-Boss Mechanics

There will be mechanics throughout each level that is not in the average snake game.

- Lasers: Lasers will disintegrate any snake part in a whole row/column
- Moving Obstacle: Moving obstacles will destroy any snake part it hits

### Bosses

Bosses will show up after 3~5 rooms consistently. They will have a unique mechanic unlike any normal room and will give the player more of a challenge.

When a player defeats a boss, there will be a button that pops out that says "**Buyout**" to add more elements of capitalism. 

Current Ideas:
- Dark Owl: Less vision in the map
- Hawk: Speeds up the game by 1.5 or so
- King Cobra: Spits poisons around the map
- Hedge Hog: Shoots spikes
- Robo Dile: Shoots lasers around the map
- Other ideas: Enemy that creates AI that will chase you

### Economy

The player's economy will be based on the snake's size at the end of each round.

Renaming your score to company Value. Company Value = Total Score

Stocks - Going up and down. It could be RNG. Stocks could change.
Supply/Demands - Shop stuff. Things that don't get bought often enough will become cheaper.

IDEAS:
Shop Items that shrink yourself

### Scoring

Total score will be immediately added after collecting Food

Timer and Score to get through level

If the snake loses parts during the run, they will lose score

Company Value = Total Score

IDEAS:
Best strat rn is to stay as  small as possible.
(Tie Victory to Score)
I'll need score for current score and total score gotten

### Shop

Shops will be where the player will be able to buy power-ups that are temporary and permanent upgrades. After defeating a boss, the player will get an option to get a permanent run item.

Note: Maybe we’ll have one time use items that will be purchasable as well later

Shops will contain:
- Abilities
- Perks: Effect that will be applied throughout the run until death

### Abilities

Abilities are something a player can usually use only once per room. Abilities are kept forever unless the player decides to sell it. 

Players will start with 1 ability slot. There's up to 4 ability slot a player can have. 

Abilities are purchased at the [[#Shop]].

Ideas for some abilities:
- A* path finding to the nearest food block when there is food. If there's no food, it will not be activatable.
- Slowing down the speed temporarily
- Allow the player to wrap around the room temporarily
- Disable all room obstacles temporarily

### Food

Food will spawn around the map every X seconds.

Consuming food will make the snake longer usually.

Players will be able to buy perks to make the food that spawns do more than just make the snake longer.

Ideas for some food upgrades:
- Extra HP. The snake can be hit by an obstacle or laser once before losing the part
- Extra Score. Food will provide an extra score
- There can be up to 2 food on the map at any point

## UI/UX Design

Clean, easy to read, minimalist. Only show what is needed.

A bunch of it is diegetic

Simple block UI

## Non-Essential Mechanics (Extra)

### Unlockable Snake Types

After getting X amount of score using the base snake, players will be able to unlock a new Snake type with a more interesting base mechanic.

### Infinite Run

Players will be able to play the game indefinitely with the same snake if they wish to do so. The game will continuously become harder due to the game becoming faster and faster per room.

### Just Notes

Demands
Monopoly - Growing exponentially big. The growth of the snake, consuming competitors.
You could buy out other Investors or other companies. You get all their upgrades when you have enough apples. The bosses are the people you're buying out. When defeat the boss, you buy them out. They're trying to stop you. 
When you get them, maybe you unlock an ability slot + ability maybe. When you buy them out, you get some dividends? (MAYBE)

Stocks - Going up and down. It could be RNG. Stocks could change
Supply/Demands - Shop stuff. Things that don't get bought often enough will become cheaper

### Map Generation

Some sort of map generation

## Audio Design

Arcady audio for the sounds?

Something that sounds fun for music. Synthwave?

## Fun Ideas:

Every time you complete a room, all the faces of the grid scales smaller and rotates creating that “dissolve” looking effect. And highlights the grid to be green. When you lose, the grid will dissolve but it’ll highlight in red.

A Snake map where the obstacle is continuously moving down every 1~2 second or so. New obstacles spawn from the top.

Sort of creates the illusion that the player feels like they’re moving upwards.

Locked in ability. Players can't sell abilities.

Story mode and Infinite mode.
