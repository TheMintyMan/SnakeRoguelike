**Snake Alive! (Macintosh game)**

Maybe I could take the idea of keys and chests.
There's multiple rooms. Maybe I could make the game have multiple rooms somehow later down the track.

I like that there's flags and boxes a player can push around. When the Snake goes into the flagged area, the flag kills anything in that area.

The game loop is perfect. I like that the rounds are set to 2 average rounds, then into the boss round. There's a lot of elements of the UI that stays the same regardless of what area of the game the player is at, whether they're at the shop or fighting the enemy.

Love the simple office aesthetic. The story is good.

**Severance**
Love the story and the aesthetic. That retro futuristic style to everything. It's like a mix of old stuff, current stuff and technology that doesn't exist in our world. It's pretty epic
