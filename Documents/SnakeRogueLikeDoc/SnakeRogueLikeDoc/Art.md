# Art Style

Simple, Arcady. 3D top down orthographic looking view.

That pixel looks. (Rough Idea)

A touch of synthwave look reminiscent of games like geometry dash

# Art Assets

I’ll probably create an asset list somewhere else that’s a bit more appropriate for creating asset lists.

# Narrative
You’re a hungry snake. You just want to eat and get big. And also, you’re a snake that wants to survive. 

Maybe something like, you’ve been disowned by your own royal snake family. It was decided by the king snake. You get tossed off a modern skyscraper by two of the royal snake guards and you must now climb your way up from the ground to prove that you’re worthy of the royal snake family. Something wacky like that. 

The final boss could be to fight the snake king himself. I would love to have something like you do in one of the few last fights you do in Undertale for the final fight but for this game. 

Ends with the king snake and you both end up losing most of their body and ends with a story of, it’s okay to not be the longest king snake. Something like that.

Buuutttt. Story is pretty much non-existent for now and will probably stay non-existent.
