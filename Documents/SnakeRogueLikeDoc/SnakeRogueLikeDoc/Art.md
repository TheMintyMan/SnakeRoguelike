# Art Style

Simple. Retro-Futuristic aesthetic.

References: Severance, Loki, Stanley Parable, Deathloop

That pixel looks. (Rough Idea)

A touch of synthwave look reminiscent of games like geometry dash

# Art Assets

I’ll probably create an asset list somewhere else that’s a bit more appropriate for creating asset lists.

- [ ] Game console
- [ ] Computer
- [ ] Snake++ Game Environment
- [ ] Snake++ Game UI
- [ ] IRL Game Environment
- [ ] IRL Game UI

Email UI. Retro futuristic UI layout.

The players will only be able to open "unread" emails. 
With each unread email, the player will have an option of 2. 
Reply "Sure" or "Nah" which will be displayed as 2 big buttons at the bottom of the email.
