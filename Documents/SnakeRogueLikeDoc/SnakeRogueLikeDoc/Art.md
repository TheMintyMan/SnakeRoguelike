Simple. Retro-Futuristic aesthetic.

That pixel looks. (Rough Idea)

A touch of synthwave look reminiscent of games like geometry dash

## Character

What does the head look like?
Ideas:
-  Tongue Mesh that faces the direction the snake is moving
-  A hat  that the snake is

Tongue mesh and a head mesh


Does the tail have a distinct look?

Email UI. Retro futuristic UI layout.

The players will only be able to open "unread" emails. 
With each unread email, the player will have an option of 2. 
Reply "Sure" or "Nah" which will be displayed as 2 big buttons at the bottom of the email.
