1 mechanic is that boss in real life starts talking to you and have to flip the device over so that your IRL boss doesn't see you playing the game. Eye icon shows up and shows "Flip Device". When bar gets full, the game punishes you by shooting extra lasers or something

Add a screen effect to the capsule art

Questions to myself:

How much of the meta am I incorporating into the game?

Rewarding in terms of area

Designing ways the narrative can be told

In-between rounds, you could go through your email. During the peace period

The game is more real to you than the world you are in.
