JUICE
Screen shake

Maybe I need to get rid of the button animation stuff because it's not made to be a game boy.

Demands
Monopoly - Growing exponentially big. The growth of the snake, consuming competitors.
You could buy out other Investors or other companies. You get all their upgrades when you have enough apples. The bosses are the people you're buying out. When defeat the boss, you buy them out. They're trying to stop you. 
When you get them, maybe you unlock an ability slot + ability maybe. When you buy them out, you get some dividends? (MAYBE)

Renaming your score to company Value. Company Value = Total Score

Stocks - Going up and down. It could be RNG. Stocks could change
Supply/Demands - Shop stuff. Things that don't get bought often enough will become cheaper



Tagline, father son, game boy aesthetic

New narrative:
Inception

You're a character in the real world at a desk job
You decide to play Snake++ instead of doing work

Starts off with a first person animated sequence of you sitting down at the desk turning the computer on

The character in the game is a nobody trying to become a CEO

Little E-mails and messages pop up in game

Escapism

1 mechanic is that boss in real life starts talking to you and have to flip the device over so that your IRL boss doesn't see you playing the game. Eye icon shows up and shows "Flip Device". When bar gets full, the game punishes you by shooting extra lasers or something

Pop-ups show up in game

At the end of the day, you win the game but you get made redundant IRL

Thank you for your years of service. Unfortunately

Straight to black, TV turns off. Credits roll

Add a screen effect to the capsule art

It's a game boy that has pop out elements such as buttons and enemy bosses

Gameplay Effects are good for passive effects/buffs, etc

Watch videos on GAS before.



Questions to myself:

How much of the meta am I incorporating into the game?

Rewarding in terms of area

Designing ways the narrative can be told

In-between rounds, you could go through your email. During the peace period



The game is more real to you than the world you are in.
