Demands
Monopoly - Growing exponentially big. The growth of the snake, consuming competitors.
You could buy out other Investors or other companies. You get all their upgrades when you have enough apples. The bosses are the people you're buying out. When defeat the boss, you buy them out. They're trying to stop you. 
When you get them, maybe you unlock an ability slot + ability maybe. When you buy them out, you get some dividends? (MAYBE)

Renaming your score to company Value. Company Value = Total Score
